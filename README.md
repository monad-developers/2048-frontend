`Monad 2048` is a fully on-chain game implementation of the popular sliding puzzle game 2048. This game connects with a smart contract
on [Monad testnet](https://testnet.monad.xyz/) and records every game and every move on-chain.

## Development

Clone the repo and run the following to install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Set the environment variables in your `.env.local` file (see `.env.local.example`). Then run the following to run the game locally:

```bash
bun dev
```
